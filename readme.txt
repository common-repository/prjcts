== Usage ==

There are several ways to display Custom Post Types (CPT) and custom taxonomies in a WordPress theme. Here are some basic examples:

* Single Template (single-prjcts.php): When you create a CPT, you can create a specific template to display individual posts of that type by using a single-{post_type}.php file.
* Archive Template (archive-prjcts.php): To display a list of all posts of a particular CPT, you can create an archive-{post_type}.php file.
* Custom Taxonomy Template (taxonomy-prjcts_category.php): To display terms of a custom taxonomy associated with the CPT, you can create a file like taxonomy-{taxonomy}.php, where 'prjcts_category' is the name of the taxonomy.
* You can use WP_Query to create custom queries anywhere in your theme. For example, if you want to display posts from a CPT on a specific page, you can create a new query:

    `
    <?php

    &#36;args = array(
        'post_type' => 'prjcts',
        'posts_per_page' => 10,
    );

    &#36;the_query = new WP_Query(&#36;args);

    if (&#36;the_query->have_posts()) :
        while (&#36;the_query->have_posts()) : &#36;the_query->the_post();

            // YOUR MARKUP HERE

        endwhile;
        wp_reset_postdata();
    else :
        echo 'No posts found';
    endif;

    ?>
    `
